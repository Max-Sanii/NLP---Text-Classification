Project Description
This project is about classifying whether the word 'mouse' in a sentence is referring to a mouse as animal or as a computer mouse. The dataset consists of separate texts containing the word 'mouse'. The texts are first preprocessed by NLP techniques such as Tokenization, Lemmatization, and Stop Words Removal. Then they are converted into vectors by utilizing three different word embedding approaches (Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, N-gram level). The feature vectors are then fed into two classifiers (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayesian). The trained models are used for classifying the validation texts. At last, Ensemble Models are used to combine the best 3 performing models in order to improve the performance.
